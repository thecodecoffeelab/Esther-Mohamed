        <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist who is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. He developed high-yield, 
          disease-resistant wheat varieties that were adopted throughout the world during the Green Revolution in the 1960s. For his work, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.
